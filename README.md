The TechTrove application is oriented towards the educational field, providing resources to encourage users in the process of learning computer science.

The resources provided by the application are presented in the form of lessons that cover the basic elements needed to understand the C++ programming language. The testing methods are varied, as the application targets self-learning through recap questions at the end of the lessons, multiple-choice tests focusing on one or at most two categories, and missions.

The user's level is determined based on a score, which is represented by a badge. The application's virtual currency is used to access specific information during certain testing stages, serving as a medium of exchange to acquire knowledge. Users accumulate coins in an account that can hold any number of coins, though it is limited by a zero value when it comes to spending them.

To provide assistance within the application, there is a chatbot with which the user can interact to learn various aspects related to the application. The user has the ability to track their progress in a competitive manner by viewing a leaderboard, as well as in a self-assessment manner through a graph that represents each significant or constructive change in their educational journey.

The application's design is user-friendly, ensuring that it does not hinder the user's progress. The application does not have a social interaction component, focusing solely on the educational aspect.
